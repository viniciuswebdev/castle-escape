# Castle Escape

I developed this game during the course [Intro to HTML5 game development](https://www.udemy.com/intro-to-html5-game-development/), I'm using  [Quintus](https://github.com/cykod/Quintus) as game engine and [Tiled map editor](www.mapeditor.org) to generate the tiles and I got a public licensed sprite from [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/). I'm using only javascript, html and css.

To run the game you just need to run a web server on the root dir, for example using PHP.

php -S localhost:80
